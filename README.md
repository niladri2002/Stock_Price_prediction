## Introduction

This project aims to predict the closing price of a stock based on historical data. It utilizes a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset of stock prices. Users can input various parameters such as opening price, high price, low price, adjusted close price, and volume to obtain a predicted closing price for a stock.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd stock-price-prediction
```

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python stock_price_prediction.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to input the relevant parameters and obtain a predicted closing price.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is stored in a CSV file named "prices.csv." It contains historical stock price data, including columns for 'Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume.' The 'Close' price is used as the target variable for prediction.

## How It Works

The project works as follows:

1. Data is loaded and preprocessed from the provided dataset.
2. A Linear Regression model is trained on the historical stock price data.
3. Users are prompted to input relevant parameters such as opening price, high price, low price, adjusted close price, and volume.
4. The trained model predicts the closing price based on the user's input.
5. The predicted closing price is displayed to the user.
